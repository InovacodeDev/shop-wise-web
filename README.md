## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking is enabled
- **Formatting**: Code is formatted with Prettier
- **Linting**: Use Prettier for code consistency
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features

### Internationalization

The app supports multiple languages using Lingui:

1. Add new messages using the `t` function from `@lingui/react/macro`
2. Extract messages: `pnpm run extract`
3. Compile messages: `pnpm run compile`

### Component Patterns

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the established UI component patterns
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Implement proper error boundaries
